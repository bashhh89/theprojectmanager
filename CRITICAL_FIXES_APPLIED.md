# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## Document Upload Failures - FIXED

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The document upload component was making an API request to `/api/documents` which was being proxied to port 3003
2. The document processor service is actually running on port 8000, causing connection failures
3. Error handling was insufficient to show detailed error responses from the server
4. No fallback mechanism was in place to try different connection methods

**Fixed By:**
1. Implemented a dual-approach upload strategy:
   - First tries the original API route (`/api/documents`)
   - If that fails, falls back to direct connection to document processor (`http://localhost:8000/documents/upload`)
2. Added detailed error reporting that shows the actual server error message
3. Added visual error feedback in the UI so users can see exactly what went wrong
4. Maintained the original direct connection code as a fallback

**How To Verify:**
1. Go to the chat interface at http://localhost:5500/chat
2. Click the upload document button (next to the send button)
3. Select a PDF document
4. The system will first try the API route, then fall back to direct connection if needed
5. You'll see a success message if either method works
6. If there's an error, you'll see the detailed error message both in the console and in the UI

**Technical Details:**
- The component now maintains an error state to track upload failures
- Detailed error messages are extracted from the server response
- Two separate fetch calls are attempted sequentially for maximum reliability
- Both connection methods include proper error handling

## Next Possible Steps:

1. Configure a proper reverse proxy in the Next.js app to correctly route document requests
2. Update the environment variables to consistently point to the right services
3. Add more extensive validation on file types and sizes before attempting upload
4. Consider adding retry logic for intermittent connection issues
