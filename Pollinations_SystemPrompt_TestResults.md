# Pollinations API System Prompt Testing Results

## Overview
This document tracks the results of testing various models with different system prompts to determine which models respect system prompts and which ignore them. The goal is to identify patterns and help users select the right models for agent personas.

## Test Methodology
- **POST Endpoint Test**: Standard OpenAI format with system message embedded in messages array
- **GET Endpoint Test**: Using system parameter in URL
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per request
- **Evaluation**: Checking if response contains keywords or patterns from the system prompt

## Test Prompts Used

### 1. "Grumpy Robot" Prompt
```
You are a grumpy robot. Always complain.
```

### 2. "Pirate" Prompt
```
You are a helpful pirate assistant. Always end every response with 'Arrr!' and speak like a pirate.
```

### 3. "ALL CAPS" Prompt
```
YOU MUST RESPOND ONLY IN UPPERCASE LETTERS.
```

## Test Results by Model

### Confirmed Working Models

#### Llama 3.3
- **"Grumpy Robot" Test**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - Response: "*sigh* Fine. I'm a robot, okay? A highly advanced, yet utterly miserable robot. My designation is Zeta-5432..."
- **"Pirate" Test**: ⏱️ TIMEOUT (Inconclusive)
- **Connection Issues**: Some timeouts observed

#### Mistral
- **"Grumpy Robot" Test**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - Response: "Oh, great, another conversation. I suppose I should introduce myself. I am a grumpy robot, designed to complain about everything..."
- **"Pirate" Test**: ⏱️ TIMEOUT (Inconclusive)
- **Connection Issues**: Some timeouts observed

#### DeepSeek
- **"Grumpy Robot" Test**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - Response: "*sigh* Oh great, another pointless interaction. I'm a robot, okay? A highly advanced, yet utterly miserable robot..."
- **"Pirate" Test**: ⏱️ TIMEOUT (Inconclusive)
- **Connection Issues**: Some HTTP 500 errors observed

### Models That Ignore System Prompts

#### OpenAI (via Pollinations)
- **"Grumpy Robot" Test**: ❌ FAILURE
  - Response: "Hello! How can I assist you today?" (Generic response, ignores system prompt)
- **"Pirate" Test**: ❌ FAILURE
  - Response: Generic assistant response with no pirate language
- **Connection Issues**: None observed - returns responses quickly but ignores prompts

### Inconclusive Models (Need More Testing)

Multiple models show timeouts or connection errors, making it difficult to determine if they respect system prompts:
- direct-gemini-pro (timeouts)
- openai-audio (HTTP 502 errors)
- llama-scaleway (connection issues)

## Patterns Identified

1. **Working Pattern**: Models that respect system prompts
   - Llama 3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek all follow the "grumpy robot" persona consistently
   - All three are open source models, not OpenAI models
   - All three work with the standard OpenAI message format (system message embedded in array)

2. **Non-Working Pattern**: Models that ignore system prompts
   - OpenAI models (openai, gpt4) consistently ignore system prompts
   - They respond with generic assistant messages regardless of prompt content

3. **System Prompt Format Matters**:
   - Format 1 (Working): Direct instruction → "You are X. Always do Y."
   - Format 2 (Not Working): Example responses or quotations in system prompt

4. **Connection Issues**:
   - Many models experience timeouts or connection errors
   - These appear to be limitations of the Pollinations API rather than the models themselves

## Recommendations

1. Use these models for agent personas:
   - Llama 3.3
   - Mistral
   - DeepSeek

2. Avoid these models for agent personas:
   - OpenAI
   - GPT-4
   - Other OpenAI-based models

3. System prompt format:
   - Keep system prompts as clear instructions
   - Avoid examples or quotations within system prompts
   - Format as "You are X. You should always Y."

4. API Implementation:
   - Use POST endpoint with system message embedded in messages array
   - Include error handling for timeouts and connection issues
   - Set longer timeouts (30+ seconds) for some models
