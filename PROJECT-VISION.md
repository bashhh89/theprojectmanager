3. **AI-Augmented Workflow**: AI agents assist in all aspects of business operations
4. **Customization & Flexibility**: Support for multiple brands, projects, and business needs
5. **Professional Quality Output**: Enterprise-grade deliverables across all content types
6. **Intuitive User Experience**: Simplified workflows for complex business operations

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js app with app router (`^15.2.4` found)
  - React components (`^18.2.0`) with TypeScript (`^5.4.2`)
  - Tailwind CSS for styling (`^3.4.1`) with Shadcn UI / Radix (`@radix-ui/*`)
  - Zustand for state management (`^4.5.2`)
  - React Hook Form for form handling (`^7.51.0`) with Zod (`^3.22.4`)

- **Backend**: *(Primarily using the integrated Supabase Platform)*
  - **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-Service platform providing:
      - **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed by Supabase), accessed via `@supabase/supabase-js`.
      - **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (via `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr` helpers).
      - **Storage:** Supabase Storage for file uploads and management.
      - **Serverless Functions:** Supabase Edge Functions (e.g., `supabase/functions/document-status-webhook`).
      - **Realtime:** Supabase Realtime capabilities.
  - **API Routes:** Standard Next.js API Routes (`src/app/api/*`) are also used for backend logic alongside Supabase Functions.
  - *Note: Previous documentation mentioning Prisma, NextAuth.js, or Redis is inaccurate. These technologies are **not** currently used in the codebase.*

- **AI Integration**:
  - OpenAI (`openai ^3.3.0`) and Google Generative AI (`@google/generative-ai ^0.24.0`) SDKs.
  - Vercel AI SDK (`ai ^2.2.35`) for streaming UI updates.
  - Pollinations API client (`src/lib/pollinationsApi.ts`) providing:
    - Image Generation/Embedding via `image.pollinations.ai/prompt/` endpoint.
    - Text Generation via `text.pollinations.ai` endpoint.
  - AnythingLLM integration (`src/lib/anythingllm-*.ts`).
  - **Vector Database:** Capabilities likely provided by **AnythingLLM** integration; direct usage of Supabase `pgvector` is not confirmed in current migrations.
  - Embedding models for semantic search (Potentially via AI SDKs or AnythingLLM).

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Vercel for application hosting (Assumed based on Next.js standard).
  - Supabase Platform for backend infrastructure.
  - Supabase CLI likely used for database migrations (see `supabase/migrations/`).
  - Docker for local development (Not directly confirmed from file list, but standard).
